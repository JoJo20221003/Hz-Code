The code is written into two versions such as the two binning method. The process is the same for both of them, the only difference is the number of parameters. 
The txt file such as "SNbin1.txt" means the SNe sample which is in the first bin. We manually bin the data for parallel computation. You can change the code to a "for circulation", if you do not want to bin the data. Let the code to decide the data need to be binned to which redshift interval.
The code "removing correlation" is used to remove the correlation between these parameters.
